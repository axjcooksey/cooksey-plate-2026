## üîë Critical Path Items

### Must Complete Before Moving Forward
1. **Squiggle API caching** - Prevents rate limiting
2. **Database schema** - Foundation for everything
3. **Family group logic** - Core permission system
4. **Historical import** - Needed for ladder accuracy

### Can Be Done In Parallel
- Frontend styling while backend develops
- Scheduler while import tools built
- Documentation while testing

## üìã Data Import Strategy

### Excel to Database Mapping
```javascript
// Excel columns ‚Üí Database fields
{
  "Person": "users.name",
  "Round X - Game Y": "tips.selected_team",
  "Correct": "tips.is_correct",
  
  // Process flow:
  // 1. Read Excel row by row
  // 2. For each person and round
  // 3. Generate squiggle_game_key (e.g., Round 2 Game 9 = "029")
  // 4. Match with squiggle_games table using key
  // 5. Validate team names
  // 6. Calculate correctness
  // 7. Insert into tips table with squiggle_game_key
}

// Key generation examples:
// Round 0, Game 1 ‚Üí "001"
// Round 2, Game 9 ‚Üí "029"
// Round 10, Game 3 ‚Üí "103"
// Round 23, Game 5 ‚Üí "235"
```

### Validation Checklist
