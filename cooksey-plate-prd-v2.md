## 2. Core Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Squiggle API ‚Üí Local Database Cache ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí React Frontend
                        ‚Üë
                Historical Data Import (Excel)
```

### Database Schema (Essential Tables)
```sql
-- Squiggle API Mirror (complete copy of API data)
squiggle_games (
  id, 
  squiggle_game_key VARCHAR(3), -- Custom key: RoundNumber + GameNumber (e.g., "001", "029", "235")
  round_number,
  game_number,
  year,
  complete,
  date,
  tz,
  hteam,
  ateam,
  hscore,
  ascore,
  hgoals,
  agoals,
  hbehinds,
  abehinds,
  venue,
  winner,
  updated,
  raw_json, -- Store complete API response
  created_at,
  updated_at
)

-- Core application tables (linked via squiggle_game_key)
users (id, name, email, family_group_id, role, created_at)
family_groups (id, name, created_at)
rounds (id, round_number, year, status, lockout_time)
games (
  id, 
  squiggle_game_key VARCHAR(3), -- Links to squiggle_games table
  round_id, 
  home_team, 
  away_team, 
  home_score, 
  away_score, 
  start_time, 
  venue, 
  is_complete
)
tips (id, user_id, game_id, squiggle_game_key, round_id, selected_team, is_correct, created_at)

-- Historical import tables
historical_tips (id, user_name, round, game_number, squiggle_game_key, selected_team, is_correct, year)
import_logs (id, import_type, status, records_processed, created_at)
```

### Squiggle Game Key Logic
```javascript
// Generate squiggle_game_key
function generateSquiggleKey(roundNumber, gameNumber) {
  // Pad round to 2 digits, game to 1 digit
  const round = String(roundNumber).padStart(2, '0');
  const game = String(gameNumber);
  return `${round}${game}`;
}

// Examples:
// Round 0, Game 1 = "001"
// Round 2, Game 9 = "029" 
// Round 23, Game 5 = "235"
// Round 10, Game 3 = "103"
```

## 9. Round Status Business Logic

### Overview
The application implements sophisticated round status determination based on Squiggle API completion data with specific business rules for optimal user experience.

### Round Status Definitions

#### Status Types
1. **"upcoming"** - Round not yet started, tips can be submitted
2. **"active"** - Round in progress, tips locked, games being played
3. **"completed"** - All games finished, results available

#### Determination Logic (Using Squiggle API `complete` field 0-100)

```javascript
// Round Status Rules (implemented in TipsService.updateRoundStatus):

if (all games have complete = 100) {
  status = "completed"
} else if (some games have 0 < complete < 100 OR current time > first game start time) {
  status = "active"  
} else if (all games have complete = 0 AND current time < first game start time) {
  status = "upcoming"
}
```

### Current Round Selection Logic

#### 2-Day Grace Period Rule
After a round is completed (all games complete = 100), the system continues showing that completed round as the "current round" for **2 days** after the last game finishes. On the 3rd day, it switches to the next upcoming/active round.

```javascript
// Current Round Algorithm (implemented in TipsService.getCurrentRound):

1. Find most recently completed round
2. If completed round exists AND we're within 2 days of last game time:
   ‚Üí Return completed round (grace period)
3. Else find active round:
   ‚Üí Return first active round
4. Else find upcoming round:  
   ‚Üí Return first upcoming round
5. Else return latest available round
```

#### Grace Period Calculation
```javascript
const lastGameTime = new Date(latestCompletedRound.last_game_time);
const twoDaysAfter = new Date(lastGameTime.getTime() + (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
const now = new Date();

if (now <= twoDaysAfter) {
  // Still in grace period - show completed round
  return completedRound;
} else {
  // Grace period over - show next round
  return nextRound;
}
```

### Default Round Behavior

#### Tipping Page
- Always defaults to current round (determined by algorithm above)
- Uses `currentRound` from AppContext automatically
- Shows round status indicator (Open/In Progress/Completed)
- Locks tips when round status is not 'upcoming'

#### All Tips Page  
- Defaults to current round when page loads
- Implemented via React useEffect:
```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (currentRound && selectedRound === null) {
    setSelectedRound(currentRound.id);
  }
}, [currentRound, selectedRound]);
```
- Shows round status indicators in dropdown (üü¢ Completed, üî¥ Active, ‚è≥ Upcoming)

### Status Update Automation

#### Backend Processing
- `updateAllRoundStatuses(year)` - Updates all rounds for a year
- `updateRoundStatus(roundId)` - Updates single round using Squiggle data
- Joins rounds ‚Üí games ‚Üí squiggle_games to get completion data
- Automatically sets lockout_time to first game time if not set

#### Database Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
  r.*,
  COUNT(sg.id) as total_games,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sg.complete = 100 THEN 1 END) as completed_games,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sg.complete > 0 AND sg.complete < 100 THEN 1 END) as in_progress_games,
  MIN(sg.date) as first_game_time,
  MAX(sg.date) as last_game_time
FROM rounds r
LEFT JOIN games g ON r.id = g.round_id
LEFT JOIN squiggle_games sg ON g.squiggle_game_key = sg.squiggle_game_key
WHERE r.id = ?
GROUP BY r.id
```

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Seamless Transition**: Users see completed rounds for 2 days to review results
2. **Automatic Progression**: System automatically moves to next round after grace period  
3. **Clear Status Indicators**: Visual feedback on round state across all pages
4. **Consistent Defaults**: Both Tipping and All Tips use same current round logic
5. **Real-time Updates**: Status updates based on live Squiggle API data

### Implementation Files

- **Backend**: `/backend/src/services/TipsService.ts` (lines 163-290)
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/src/pages/TippingPage.tsx` (uses currentRound from context)
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx` (lines 13-18, default selection)
