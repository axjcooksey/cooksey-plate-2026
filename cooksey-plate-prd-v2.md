                        ‚Üë
                Historical Data Import (Excel)
```

### Database Schema (Essential Tables)
```sql
-- Squiggle API Mirror (complete copy of API data)
squiggle_games (
  id, 
  squiggle_game_key VARCHAR(3), -- Custom key: RoundNumber + GameNumber (e.g., "001", "029", "235")

  year,
  complete,
  date,
  tz,
  hteam,
  ateam,
  hscore,
  ascore,
  hgoals,
  agoals,
  hbehinds,
  abehinds,
  venue,
  winner,
  updated,
  raw_json, -- Store complete API response
  created_at,
  updated_at
)

-- Core application tables (linked via squiggle_game_key)
users (id, name, email, family_group_id, role, created_at)
family_groups (id, name, created_at)
rounds (id, round_number, year, status, lockout_time)
games (
  id, 
  squiggle_game_key VARCHAR(3), -- Links to squiggle_games table
  round_id, 
  home_team, 
  away_team, 
  home_score, 
  away_score, 
  start_time, 
  venue, 
  is_complete
)
tips (id, user_id, game_id, squiggle_game_key, round_id, selected_team, is_correct, created_at)

-- Historical import tables
historical_tips (id, user_name, round, game_number, squiggle_game_key, selected_team, is_correct, year)
import_logs (id, import_type, status, records_processed, created_at)
```

### Squiggle Game Key Logic
```javascript
// Generate squiggle_game_key
function generateSquiggleKey(roundNumber, gameNumber) {
  // Pad round to 2 digits, game to 1 digit
  const round = String(roundNumber).padStart(2, '0');
  const game = String(gameNumber);
  return `${round}${game}`;
}

// Examples:
// Round 0, Game 1 = "001"
// Round 2, Game 9 = "029" 
// Round 23, Game 5 = "235"
// Round 10, Game 3 = "103"
```

## 9. Round Status Business Logic

### Overview
The application implements sophisticated round status determination based on Squiggle API completion data with specific business rules for optimal user experience.

### Round Status Definitions

#### Status Types
1. **"upcoming"** - Round not yet started, tips can be submitted
2. **"active"** - Round in progress, tips locked, games being played
3. **"completed"** - All games finished, results available

#### Determination Logic (Using Squiggle API `complete` field 0-100)

```javascript
// Round Status Rules (implemented in TipsService.updateRoundStatus):

if (all games have complete = 100) {
  status = "completed"
} else if (some games have 0 < complete < 100 OR current time > first game start time) {
  status = "active"  
} else if (all games have complete = 0 AND current time < first game start time) {
  status = "upcoming"
}
```

### Current Round Selection Logic

#### 2-Day Grace Period Rule
After a round is completed (all games complete = 100), the system continues showing that completed round as the "current round" for **2 days** after the last game finishes. On the 3rd day, it switches to the next upcoming/active round.

```javascript
// Current Round Algorithm (implemented in TipsService.getCurrentRound):

1. Find most recently completed round
2. If completed round exists AND we're within 2 days of last game time:
   ‚Üí Return completed round (grace period)
3. Else find active round:
   ‚Üí Return first active round
4. Else find upcoming round:  
   ‚Üí Return first upcoming round
5. Else return latest available round
```

#### Grace Period Calculation
```javascript
const lastGameTime = new Date(latestCompletedRound.last_game_time);
const twoDaysAfter = new Date(lastGameTime.getTime() + (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
const now = new Date();

if (now <= twoDaysAfter) {
  // Still in grace period - show completed round
  return completedRound;
} else {
  // Grace period over - show next round
  return nextRound;
}
```

### Default Round Behavior

#### Tipping Page
- Always defaults to current round (determined by algorithm above)
- Uses `currentRound` from AppContext automatically
- Shows round status indicator (Open/In Progress/Completed)
- Locks tips when round status is not 'upcoming'

#### All Tips Page  
- Defaults to current round when page loads
- Implemented via React useEffect:
```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (currentRound && selectedRound === null) {
    setSelectedRound(currentRound.id);
  }
}, [currentRound, selectedRound]);
```
- Shows round status indicators in dropdown (üü¢ Completed, üî¥ Active, ‚è≥ Upcoming)

### Status Update Automation

#### Backend Processing
- `updateAllRoundStatuses(year)` - Updates all rounds for a year
- `updateRoundStatus(roundId)` - Updates single round using Squiggle data
- Joins rounds ‚Üí games ‚Üí squiggle_games to get completion data
- Automatically sets lockout_time to first game time if not set

#### Database Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
  r.*,
  COUNT(sg.id) as total_games,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sg.complete = 100 THEN 1 END) as completed_games,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sg.complete > 0 AND sg.complete < 100 THEN 1 END) as in_progress_games,
  MIN(sg.date) as first_game_time,
  MAX(sg.date) as last_game_time
FROM rounds r
LEFT JOIN games g ON r.id = g.round_id
LEFT JOIN squiggle_games sg ON g.squiggle_game_key = sg.squiggle_game_key
WHERE r.id = ?
GROUP BY r.id
```

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Seamless Transition**: Users see completed rounds for 2 days to review results
2. **Automatic Progression**: System automatically moves to next round after grace period  
3. **Clear Status Indicators**: Visual feedback on round state across all pages
4. **Consistent Defaults**: Both Tipping and All Tips use same current round logic
5. **Real-time Updates**: Status updates based on live Squiggle API data

### Implementation Files

- **Backend**: `/backend/src/services/TipsService.ts` (lines 163-290)
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/src/pages/TippingPage.tsx` (uses currentRound from context)
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx` (lines 13-18, default selection)
- **Helpers**: `/frontend/src/utils/helpers.ts` (round status display functions)
- **Database**: Squiggle games table with `complete` field (0-100)

---

## 10. Complex Tip Submission Lockout Rules

### Overview
The application implements sophisticated lockout logic that balances competition integrity with user flexibility. The system allows users to submit tips up until individual games start, but prevents changes once a user has submitted tips and the round begins.

### Core Lockout Principles

#### 1. **Individual Game Lockout**
- Users can submit tips for any game that hasn't started yet
- Once a game starts (Squiggle `complete` > 0), no tips can be submitted for that specific game
- Games within a round can have different lockout times based on their start times

#### 2. **Round Commitment Rule**
- **If user submits tips BEFORE first game**: After first game starts, ALL tips for that round become locked (cannot be changed)
- **If user hasn't submitted tips BEFORE first game**: User can still submit tips for remaining games that haven't started

#### 3. **Submission States**
- **"Open"**: User can submit/change tips for games that haven't started
- **"Committed"**: User submitted tips before round started - all tips locked after first game
- **"Partial Available"**: User didn't submit before round started - can tip remaining games
- **"Game Locked"**: Individual game has started - no tips allowed for that game

### Detailed Logic Flow

```javascript
// Lockout Decision Tree
function canSubmitTip(userId, gameId, roundId) {
  const game = getGame(gameId);
  const userTips = getUserRoundTips(userId, roundId);
  const round = getRound(roundId);
  
  // 1. Game-specific lockout (always enforced)
  if (game.start_time <= now || game.complete > 0) {
    return false; // Game has started or finished
  }
  
  // 2. Round commitment lockout
  const hasSubmittedTips = userTips.length > 0;
  const roundHasStarted = round.first_game_time <= now;
  
  if (hasSubmittedTips && roundHasStarted) {
    return false; // User committed tips before round started - all locked
  }
  
  // 3. Otherwise, user can submit tip
  return true;
}
```

### Visual Feedback States

#### Tip Selection Colors
- **Blue Glow**: Current selection for upcoming/active rounds
- **Green Glow**: Winning team (shows during active and completed rounds)
- **Red Glow**: Losing team for completed rounds only
- **Grey**: Unavailable option (game started, no tip submitted)

#### Game State Indicators
```javascript
// Color coding for tip buttons
const getButtonStyling = (game, userTip, isSelected) => {
  // Game finished - show results
  if (game.complete === 100) {
    if (isSelected) {
      return userTip === game.winner ? 'green-glow' : 'red-glow';
    }
    return 'grey-unavailable';
  }
  
  // Game in progress - show current winner
  if (game.complete > 0 && game.winner) {
    if (game.home_team === game.winner || game.away_team === game.winner) {
      return 'green-glow'; // Winning team
    }
  }
  
  // Game not started - show user selection
  if (isSelected) {
    return 'blue-glow'; // User's tip
  }
  
  return 'default'; // Available for selection
};
```

### Business Rules Examples

#### Scenario 1: Early Submitter
```
User submits all Round 23 tips on Wednesday
Round 23 first game starts Friday 7:30pm
Result: After Friday 7:30pm, user cannot change ANY Round 23 tips
```

#### Scenario 2: Late Submitter  
```
User doesn't submit tips before Round 23 starts Friday 7:30pm
Saturday games at 1:30pm and 4:00pm haven't started yet
Result: User can still submit tips for Saturday games until they start
```

#### Scenario 3: Individual Game Lockout
```
Friday 7:30pm game: Tips locked at 7:30pm (game started)
Saturday 1:30pm game: Tips locked at 1:30pm (game started) 
Saturday 4:00pm game: Tips available until 4:00pm
```

### Database Schema Requirements

#### Tips Table Enhancement
```sql
-- Track when tips were first submitted for lockout logic
ALTER TABLE tips ADD COLUMN first_submitted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE tips ADD COLUMN last_modified_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Index for efficient lockout queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tips_user_round_submitted ON tips(user_id, round_id, first_submitted_at);
```

#### Game State Tracking
```sql
-- Enhanced game state from Squiggle API
SELECT 
  g.*,
  sg.complete,
  sg.winner,
  CASE 
    WHEN sg.complete = 0 THEN 'upcoming'
    WHEN sg.complete > 0 AND sg.complete < 100 THEN 'active'
    WHEN sg.complete = 100 THEN 'completed'
  END as game_status
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN squiggle_games sg ON g.squiggle_game_key = sg.squiggle_game_key;
```

### Implementation Requirements

#### Backend API Changes
- `POST /api/tips/submit` - Check lockout rules before accepting tips
- `GET /api/tips/lockout-status/:userId/:roundId` - Return lockout state per game
- `PUT /api/tips/update/:tipId` - Enforce no-change rule for committed rounds

#### Frontend UX Requirements
- Real-time lockout status updates during active rounds
- Clear visual indicators for each lockout state
- Informative error messages explaining why tips can't be submitted
- Progress indicators showing which games are still available

#### Error Messages
```javascript
const lockoutMessages = {
  gameStarted: "This game has already started. Tips are locked.",
  roundCommitted: "You submitted tips before this round started. All tips are now locked.",
  gameCompleted: "This game is finished. Results are final.",
  networkError: "Unable to submit tip. Please try again."
};
```

### Testing Scenarios

#### Automated Test Cases
1. **Early submission lockout**: Submit tips, advance time past first game, verify all tips locked
2. **Late submission flexibility**: Don't submit initially, verify individual game lockouts
3. **Real-time updates**: Mock game start during active session, verify UI updates
4. **Edge cases**: Tips submitted exactly at game start time
5. **Network failures**: Handle submission failures gracefully

AdminPage.tsx                            // Complete admin dashboard
  - EditUserTips tab                      // Historical tip editing
  - DataSyncScheduler tab                 // Sync monitoring
  - Real-time status updates              // Live job information
  - Comprehensive logging interface       // Activity tracking
```

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Enhanced logging
import_logs table                         -- Comprehensive sync tracking
  - import_type, status, records_processed
  - error_messages, file_names, timestamps

-- Tip editing audit
tips table updates                        -- Admin edit tracking
  - updated_at timestamps
  - Admin user identification in logs
```

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Administrative Oversight**: Complete visibility into system operations
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Early warning of sync failures or issues  
3. **Historical Management**: Ability to correct historical tip data
4. **Performance Optimization**: Respectful API usage with maintained functionality
5. **Operational Control**: Manual override capabilities for emergency situations

### Security Considerations

- **Role-based Access**: Admin features restricted to admin users only
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged with user identification
- **Data Validation**: All edits validated against game constraints
- **Permission Verification**: Backend validates admin privileges on every request

### Planned Enhanced Admin Features

#### User Management System
**Comprehensive User Editing Capabilities**
- **Name & Family Group Management**: Admins can modify user names and reassign family group memberships
- **Role Administration**: Promote users to admin status or demote admins to regular users
- **Permission Controls**: Backend validation ensures only admins can perform user management operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all user management actions with admin identification

#### Advanced Tip Management System
**Complete Tip Creation & Editing**
- **Historical Tip Creation**: Admins can create tips for users who never submitted for specific rounds
- **Comprehensive Editing**: Modify existing tips or create new ones seamlessly in same interface
- **Retroactive Management**: Full historical tip management for any user/round combination
- **Automatic Validation**: Ensures tip correctness calculations update immediately after creation/modification

#### Auto-Calculation Integration
**Intelligent Tip Correctness Updates**
- **Real-time Calculation**: Automatic `is_correct` field updates when tips are created or modified
- **Game Result Integration**: Immediate validation against current game results and winners
- **Retroactive Updates**: Historical tip changes trigger correctness recalculation
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time display of correct/incorrect status during admin operations

#### Enhanced Admin Interface

## 12. Development Guidelines for Claude Code

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Async/await over promises
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear variable naming

### File Organization
- One component per file
- Shared types in `/types`
- API calls in `/services`
- Database queries in `/backend/db`
- Utility functions in `/utils`

### Testing Approach
- Test data import accuracy first
- Validate Squiggle integration
- Check family group permissions
- Verify ladder calculations

### Documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation with examples
- Database schema diagram
